Structured Query Language is a standard Database language which is used to create, maintain and retrieve the relational database

What is Relational Database?
Relational database means the data is stored as well as retrieved in the form of relations (tables).

These are some important terminologies that are used in terms of relation.
Attribute: Attributes are the properties that define a relation. e.g.; ROLL_NO, NAME etc.
Tuple: Each row in the relation is known as tuple.
Degree: The number of attributes in the relation is known as degree of the relation.
Cardinality: The number of tuples in a relation is known as cardinality. 
Column: Column represents the set of values for a particular attribute.

Example:
Table: STUDENT
Attributes: ROLL_NO, NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE,	AGE

The queries to deal with relational database can be categories as:
Data Definition Language: It is used to define the structure of the database. e.g; CREATE TABLE, ADD COLUMN, DROP COLUMN and so on.
Data Manipulation Language: It is used to manipulate data in the relations. e.g.; INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE and so on.
Data Query Language: It is used to extract the data from the relations. e.g.; SELECT

AGGRATION FUNCTIONS: Aggregation functions are used to perform mathematical operations on data values of a relation. 
Some of the common aggregation functions used in SQL are:

COUNT: Count function is used to count the number of rows in a relation. e.g;
SELECT COUNT (PHONE) FROM STUDENT;

SUM: SUM function is used to add the values of an attribute in a relation. e.g;
SELECT SUM (AGE) FROM STUDENT;

AVERAGE: It gives the average values of the tupples. It is also defined as sum divided by count values.
Syntax:AVG(attributename)
OR
Syntax:SUM(attributename)/COUNT(attributename)
The above mentioned syntax also retrieves the average value of tupples.

MAXIMUM:It extracts the maximum value among the set of tupples.
Syntax:MAX(attributename)

MINIMUM:It extracts the minimum value amongst the set of all the tupples.
Syntax:MIN(attributename)

GROUP BY: Group by is used to group the tuples of a relation based on an attribute or group of attribute. It is always combined with aggregation function which is computed on group. e.g.;

SELECT ADDRESS, SUM(AGE) FROM STUDENT
GROUP BY (ADDRESS);
In this query, SUM(AGE) will be computed but not for entire table but for each address. i.e.; sum of AGE for address DELHI(18+18=36) and similarly for other address as well.
