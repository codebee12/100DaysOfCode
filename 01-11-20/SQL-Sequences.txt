Sequence is a set of integers 1, 2, 3, … that are generated and supported by some database systems to produce unique values on demand.

A sequence is a user defined schema bound object that generates a sequence of numeric values.
Sequences are frequently used in many databases because many applications require each row in a table to contain a unique value and sequences provides an easy way to generate them.
The sequence of numeric values is generated in an ascending or descending order at defined intervals and can be configured to restart when exceeds max_value.
Syntax:

CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
START WITH initial_value
INCREMENT BY increment_value
MINVALUE minimum value
MAXVALUE maximum value
CYCLE|NOCYCLE ;

sequence_name: Name of the sequence.

initial_value: starting value from where the sequence starts. 
Initial_value should be greater than or equal 
to minimum value and less than equal to maximum value.

increment_value: Value by which sequence will increment itself. 
Increment_value can be positive or negative.

minimum_value: Minimum value of the sequence.
maximum_value: Maximum value of the sequence.

cycle: When sequence reaches its set_limit 
it starts from beginning.

nocycle: An exception will be thrown 
if sequence exceeds its max_value.

Example to use sequence : create a table named students with columns as id and name.
CREATE TABLE students
( 
ID number(10),
NAME char(20)
);
Now insert values into table

INSERT into students VALUES(sequence_1.nextval,'Ramesh');
INSERT into students VALUES(sequence_1.nextval,'Suresh');
where sequence_1.nextval will insert id’s in id column in a sequence as defined in sequence_1.
