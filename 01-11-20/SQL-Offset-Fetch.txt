The OFFSET argument is used to identify the starting point to return rows from a result set. Basically, it exclude the first set of records.
Note:

OFFSET can only be used with ORDER BY clause. It cannot be used on its own.
OFFSET value must be greater than or equal to zero. It cannot be negative, else return error.
Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column_name
OFFSET rows_to_skip ROWS;

The FETCH argument is used to return a set of number of rows. FETCH canâ€™t be used itself, it is used in conjuction with OFFSET.
Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name
OFFSET rows_to_skip
FETCH NEXT number_of_rows ROWS ONLY;

The LIMIT clause is used to set an upper limit on the number of tuples returned by SQL.
Example:
SELECT *
FROM Student
LIMIT 5;
