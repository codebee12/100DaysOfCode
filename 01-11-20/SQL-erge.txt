The MERGE command in SQL is actually a combination of three SQL statements: INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.

But unlike INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements MERGE statement requires a source table to perform these operations on 
the required table which is called as target table.

//.....syntax of MERGE statement....//

//you can use any other name in place of target
MERGE target_table_name AS TARGET  

//you can use any other name in place of source 
USING source_table_name AS SOURCE   
ON condition (for matching source and target table)
WHEN MATCHED (another condition for updation)

 //now use update statement syntax accordingly
THEN UPDATE                       
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET 

//now use insert statement syntax accordingly
THEN INSERT                        
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE 
THEN DELETE;
