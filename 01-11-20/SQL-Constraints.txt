The available constraints in SQL are:

NOT NULL: This constraint tells that we cannot store a null value in a column. That is, if a column is specified as NOT NULL then we will not be able to store null in this particular column any more.
UNIQUE: This constraint when specified with a column, tells that all the values in the column must be unique. That is, the values in any row of a column must not be repeated.
PRIMARY KEY: A primary key is a field which can uniquely identify each row in a table. And this constraint is used to specify a field in a table as primary key.
FOREIGN KEY: A Foreign key is a field which can uniquely identify each row in a another table. And this constraint is used to specify a field as Foreign key.
CHECK: This constraint helps to validate the values of a column to meet a particular condition. That is, it helps to ensure that the value stored in a column meets a specific condition.
DEFAULT: This constraint specifies a default value for the column when no value is specified by the user.

CREATE TABLE sample_table
(
column1 data_type(size) constraint_name,
column2 data_type(size) constraint_name,
column3 data_type(size) constraint_name,
....
);

sample_table: Name of the table to be created.
data_type: Type of data that can be stored in the field.
constraint_name: Name of the constraint. for example- NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY etc.
