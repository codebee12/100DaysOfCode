Views in SQL are kind of virtual tables. A view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database. 
We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database.
A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain condition.

Creating Views:
Syntax:

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2.....
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

view_name: Name for the View
table_name: Name of the table
condition: Condition to select rows

Deleting Views:
Syntax:

DROP VIEW view_name;

view_name: Name of the View which we want to delete.

UPDATING VIEWS

There are certain conditions needed to be satisfied to update a view. If any one of these conditions is not met, then we will not be allowed to update the view.

The SELECT statement which is used to create the view should not include GROUP BY clause or ORDER BY clause.
The SELECT statement should not have the DISTINCT keyword.
The View should have all NOT NULL values.
The view should not be created using nested queries or complex queries.
The view should be created from a single table. If the view is created using multiple tables then we will not be allowed to update the view.

Syntax:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1,coulmn2,..
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Insert and Delete in Views is same as tables

The WITH CHECK OPTION clause in SQL is a very useful clause for views. It is applicable to a updatable view. If the view is not updatable, then there is no meaning of including this clause in the CREATE VIEW statement.

The WITH CHECK OPTION clause is used to prevent the insertion of rows in the view where the condition in the WHERE clause in CREATE VIEW statement is not satisfied.
If we have used the WITH CHECK OPTION clause in the CREATE VIEW statement, and if the UPDATE or INSERT clause does not satisfy the conditions then they will return an error.
Example:
In the below example we are creating a View SampleView from StudentDetails Table with WITH CHECK OPTION clause.

CREATE VIEW SampleView AS
SELECT S_ID, NAME
FROM  StudentDetails
WHERE NAME IS NOT NULL
WITH CHECK OPTION;
In this View if we now try to insert a new row with null value in the NAME column then it will give an error because the view is created with the condition for NAME column as NOT NULL.
