 A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs. 
 For example, a trigger can be invoked when a row is inserted into a specified table or when certain table columns are being updated.

Syntax:

create trigger [trigger_name] 
[before | after]  
{insert | update | delete}  
on [table_name]  
[for each row]  
[trigger_body] 

Example:
create trigger stud_marks 
before INSERT 
on 
Student 
for each row 
set Student.total = Student.subj1 + Student.subj2 + Student.subj3, Student.per = Student.total * 60 / 100;
Above SQL statement will create a trigger in the student database in which whenever subjects marks are entered, before inserting this data into the database, 
trigger will compute those two values and insert with the entered values.
