1 - Codebase
One codebase per service, tracked in revision control; many deploys

2 – Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

3 – Config
Store configuration in the environment

4 – Backing Services
Treat backing services as attached resources

5 – Build, Release, Run
Strictly separate build and run stages

6 – Processes
Execute the app in one or more stateless processes

7 – Data Isolation
Each service manages its own data

8 – Concurrency
Scale out via the process model

9 – Disposability
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

10 – Dev/Prod Parity
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

11 – Logs
Treat logs as event streams

12 – Admin Processes
Run admin and management tasks as one‑off processes
In a production environment, run administrative and maintenance tasks separately from the app
